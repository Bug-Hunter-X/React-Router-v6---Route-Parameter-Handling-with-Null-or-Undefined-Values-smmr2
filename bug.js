In React Router Dom v6, navigating to a route with a parameter that is null or undefined can cause unexpected behavior.  For example, if you have a route like `/users/:id` and try to navigate to `/users/null`, the route may not match correctly, or you might encounter errors within your component. This happens because React Router interprets the `null` or `undefined` value literally, instead of treating it as an absence of a parameter.
