# React Router v6 - Null/Undefined Route Parameter Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue and its solution when working with route parameters that might be null or undefined in React Router v6.  The problem arises from how React Router handles these values during route matching.  The solution involves adding checks for null or undefined parameters within your route components.

## Problem

When navigating to a route with a parameter that resolves to `null` or `undefined`, the route matching can fail, or unexpected behavior may occur in your component.

## Solution

The solution provided checks for `null` or `undefined` values before accessing the route parameter.  This prevents errors and allows for graceful handling of missing parameters.
